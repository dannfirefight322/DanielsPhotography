				<p>My name is Daniel, and I'm an aspiring photographer from Texas.
			<br>I've always been fascinated with capturing photo's since highschool.
			<br> Although I never really focused on keeping a camera with at all times.
			<br>It changed when my little sister was born and I bought a used Canon
			<br>point and shoot camera. I was able to throw that camera in my pocket
			<br> and keep it on my person most of the time.I captured some priceless moments
			<br>of my kid sister's early years. I ended up upgrading to a Canon T5. This
			<br>is the camera that I tend to take with me almost everywhere now. With a family
			<br>that loves Disney we take trips to Disney World frequently. Which in turn gives
			<br>the opportunity to take photos and practice in that environment. We also love visiting
			<br>zoo's which gives me practice capturing wildlife. With two younger siblings gives
			<br>me practice capturing memories of tiny humans as well.
			<br>Hopefully I get the opportunity to capture memories for a long time.
			<br>Thank you for taking the time to visiting my website and viewing my photos.
